# FizzBuzz

For manual testing there is no reading console input implemented, you should just update `replacementByDivisor` in
`main`.

Small FizzBuzz service implemented via this app do the following:

* Accepts unsorted map with dividers as keys and replacements as values and sorts it.
* The result for each number can be:
    * The number converted to string, if it is not divisible by any of map keys.
    * The string, which represents one or more values, associated with the keys, which are dividers of a number.
